Please create an example structure for a shared infrastructure repository including directory layout, configuration files, Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform modules, and CI/CD pipelines according to the following requirements:

Requirements:

Support running multiple applications on the same infrastructure.

Development environment: Use Docker Compose to run Flask / Node / PostgreSQL / Nginx.

Production environment: Include Terraform + Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment (AWS / GCP / Azure).

CI/CD: Provide a common pipeline using GitHub Actions that performs lint → test → build → deploy.

Applications should be replaceable (adding a new app should only require changing Docker image name or service name).

Include a README.md that documents usage, architecture diagrams, and instructions for connecting applications.

Manage environment variables via .env and assume connection to secrets management.

Switching between development and production environments should be easy and clear.

Include not only file structure but also sample configuration files and templates.

Suggested directory layout:
